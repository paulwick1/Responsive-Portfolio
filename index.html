      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Paul Wicklund">

      <p>I’ve been fortunate enough to live my entire life in the great state of Texas.  I was born and raised in Waco where I attended Waco High and lettered on the varsity golf team; a hobby I still maintain today.  From there I moved on to college at Baylor University and worked toward my Business Degree in Operations Management.  If I wasn’t in the library studying the ins and outs of operations and supply chain management I could usually be found on the lake wakeboarding with my friends.  I love being on the water but unfortunately I never seem to have the time to get out there these days.</p>

      <p>After graduating from college I moved Austin, Texas where I began working with Accenture; a leading technology consulting and business process outsourcing company.  The number of opportunities provided by working for a company that large are a great asset to someone like me who is passionate about learning new skills and finding ways to apply them in unique situations. I’ve held leadership roles in multiple areas of the company such as Technology Infrastructure, Program & Project Management, Finance, Sales, and Operations. The remaining department that I have yet to work with is the application services team. In order to develop my skills in that area I have enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin’s full-stack developer boot camp.  I’m excited about the new skills I am learning in the program and look forward to seeing what future opportunities these new skills lead to in my career.</p>
